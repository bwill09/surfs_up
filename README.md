## Overview 

This project dive into enhance data storage and retrival to support the tempreture analysis in Oahu, Hawaii. It narrow down the statistics of tempreture data were requested for the month of June and December, to access if a pptential surf and ice cream venture can survive all-year operation.

## Summary
The temprature for December erractically different than the temprature of June. Surfing and Ice Cream sale would survive in December. The mean temprature 
between December and June differs by four degrees. For example, December average temprature is about 72F. This a great weather for a surfing and/or ice cream business. 

There are few more queries I'd like to do for more clearity on weather conditions in these two months 

(a) I'd like to examine tempratrue statistics on record by station each month. I believe this will aid to decide geograhical where in Oahu to set-up potential shop.

(b) Reviewing other significant typed of beach surfing weather. For example, wave, wind, precipitation etc. It'd be clever to consider thing like sunbathing vs surfing. It would be smart to not only consider temprature as a key to establishing the business
